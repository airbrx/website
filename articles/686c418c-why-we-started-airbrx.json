Companies would invest heavily in cloud platforms, orchestration tools, or data infrastructure, but six months or a year later, leaders were still asking:</p><p><br>&nbsp;<i>“Why isn’t this delivering real results?”</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t because the technology was bad. It was because the focus was off. Too often, projects got stuck optimizing the platform instead of solving the problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We knew there was a better way — and we had the experience to deliver it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A Team That’s Been Around the Block</strong></h2><p>Among us — Ben Tallman, Amit Beria, Michael Bissell, and Stephen Shannon — we’ve spent decades building and running technology and operations in complex environments:&nbsp;<strong>financial services, professional services, and high-tech SaaS</strong>. We've been clients and delivery partners. We've led companies, departments, teams, shipped product, supported customers, and built things that lasted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve also seen what&nbsp;<i>doesn’t</i> work — and how easy it is for smart teams to get bogged down chasing the wrong goals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the perspective we bring to Airbrx.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>We Don’t Do Hype</strong></h2><p>We’re not interested in chasing trends for the sake of it. The tools matter — and we know them well (Databricks, Airflow, Snowflake, AWS, GCP, Azure, dbt, and the rest) — but we see them for what they are: tools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What we care about is helping clients make real progress. That means solving actual problems, building things that are maintainable, and keeping complexity in check.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Our Approach: Build First Versions, Not Just Demos</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest traps in data and AI projects is the cycle of proofs-of-concept that never make it into production.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We avoid that. We focus on building first versions — real, usable solutions that move the needle. You can iterate on something that works. You can’t iterate on a deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why Now?</strong></h2><p>AI has changed the game. A lot of the mechanics of building software are getting easier. But that just makes&nbsp;<strong>experience, context and domain expertise</strong> even more valuable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this environment, the advantage doesn’t go to whoever builds the most — it goes to whoever understands what to build, why, and how it will drive the business forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That’s where we come in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Who We Work With</strong></h2><p>A lot of our work is in&nbsp;<strong>financial services</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>SaaS</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>professional services</strong> businesses, but we’ve also led teams and delivered outcomes in a multitude of other areas. Different industries, same challenges: legacy systems, complex processes, unclear paths to value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We help cut through that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why Airbrx?</strong></h2><p>We built Airbrx to be the kind of partner we always looked for:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Pragmatic</li><li>Technically sharp</li><li>Business-aware</li><li>Outcome-driven</li></ul><p><br>If you’re trying to make your data or AI initiatives actually matter — and you’re tired of long cycles with little to show — we’d love to talk.</p>",
