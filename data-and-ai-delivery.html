                    <p>We build sophisticated, observable data pipelines that leverage AI augmentation for enhanced automation and intelligence.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Airflow DAG Engineering</strong><br/>
                        With our deep experience in <span class="tooltip" data-key="apache-airflow">Apache Airflow</span>, we deliver production-grade <span class="tooltip" data-key="dag">DAGs</span> with 99.9% reliability and comprehensive error handling. Our engineering and architecture team has deep experience with delivering scalable, dynamic DAGs designed for observability, recovery, and portability—with full OpenLineage integration and enterprise monitoring.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>AI Enabled Pipeline Creation</strong><br/>
                        We leverage <span class="tooltip" data-key="mcps">MCP agents</span> in your favorite IDE or <span class="tooltip" data-key="astronomer">Astronomer's</span> upcoming Web IDE to co-develop <span class="tooltip" data-key="dag">DAGs</span>, accelerating non-Python developer onboarding and minimizing development lift. This often provides 60% faster pipeline development with improved code quality and team capabilities.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Streaming Event Driven Pipeline Enablement</strong><br />
                        We understand ecosystems are complex and we bring skills to build hybrid pipelines with batch + streaming components, including <span class="tooltip" data-key="kinesis">Kinesis</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-key="kafka">Kafka</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-key="spark-streaming">Spark Structured Streaming</span> orchestration. This allows us to provide real-time and batch processing unified under a single orchestration framework even with a mix of technologies.

                    <p>“Enterprise grade” solutions require observability, governance, and scalability built-in from day one. We provide project management, engineering and architectural services to deploy scalable solutions minimizing tech debt and maximizing functionality.</p>

                    <ul>

                      <li><strong>Lakehouse Platform Implementation</strong><br/>
                        The Airbrix team will deploy production-ready, scalable and open Lakehouse environments with fully configured catalogs, access policies, and CI/CD pipelines. Typically our team will spend 4-8 weeks for core platform, with ongoing optimization and feature additions
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Bronze/Silver/Gold Data Layering</strong><br />
                        We implement opinionated <span class="tooltip" data-key="medallion">medallion architecture</span> with automated validation, cost tagging, and quality controls at every layer. This provides standardized data layers with automated quality gates and lineage tracking that provides  clean, well‑governed data that’s immediately usable for analytics, AI, and cost‑efficient decision‑making.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Modular Declarative Event Driven Data Pipeline Templates</strong><br />
                        Package business logic and data transformations as reusable, tested modules that accelerate future development and ensure consistency. Our team will create a template library with documentation and document ways to adapt, customize, or enhance the base pipeline templates for different use cases or evolving needs.

                    <p>AI is rapidly becoming a series of tools and technologies that work together. “<span class="tooltip" data-key="agentic-ai">Agentic AI</span>” requires careful thought and execution to allow the models to make appropriate decisions including when to call in a human.  Our team understands these danger zones and choke points and creates systems that enable your enterprise, not confuse or endanger the outcomes.</p>

                    <ul>

                      <li><strong>Enterprise AI Agent Development</strong><br />
                        Our engineers build specialized agents for orchestration-aware use cases—e.g., auto-documenting DAGs, monitoring data SLA breaches, or surfacing insights via Slack/Teams integration. This generally takes 2-4 weeks per agent with full integration testing and documentation.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Agent + Pipeline Co-Execution</strong><br />
                        We build pipelines that adapt and optimize themselves based on data characteristics and business context by integrating agents into <span class="tooltip" data-key="dag">Airflow DAGs</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-key="databricks">Databricks</span> workflows to perform contextual augmentation, inline decision-making, or dynamic task generation based on data patterns and business rules.

                      <li><strong>Agent Guardrails &amp; Human-in-the-Loop Integration</strong><br />
                        Automation needs to be built correctly to ensure agent safety and intervention. Based on existing best practices and context of your enterprise, our team implements rule-based triggers, approval chains, and observability integrations with  <span class="tooltip" data-key="astronomer-observe">Astronomer Observe</span> and  <span class="tooltip" data-key="unity-catalog">Unity Catalog</span> and creating clear audit trails and escalation procedures.

                    <ul>

                      <li><strong>DAG Pack & Pattern Library Delivery</strong><br />
                        We create curated collections of production-grade DAGs for ingestion, transformation, lineage, and alerting—reducing development time by 70%. Generally we adopt 20+ proven DAG patterns to your enterprise needs with full documentation and customization guides.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>C4E Starter Kit</strong><br />
                        Our leadership team delivers workshop assets, reuse guides, onboarding tracks, and platform navigation flows to jumpstart enablement and adoption throughout the organization and formalize a Data <span class="tooltip" data-key="c4e">Center for Enablement (C4E)</span>.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>AI-Generated Documentation & Knowledge Base</strong><br />
                        In addition to established documentation, our team can help build tools to automatically generate pipeline documentation, runbooks, and knowledge base entries using LLM integration with code and metadata to provide always up-to-date documentation with 90% reduction in manual maintenance.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Reusable Agents & Prompt Libraries</strong><br />
                        By understanding when and how to create reusable services and agents for common enterprise roles (e.g., data validator, pipeline monitor, report summarizer) we are able to develop ready-to-deploy agents and templates with customization guides and best practices to accelerate your enterprise development of <span class="tooltip" data-key="agentic-ai">Agentic AI</span> and automation.

                    <p>Data platforms are huge and complex – building intelligent systems that can be monitored and optimized (both for performance and cost) takes an experienced team that can avoid scaling nightmares and hidden processes.</p>

                    <ul>

                      <li><strong>Cloud Platform Efficiency Review</strong><br />
                        Our architects and engineers will analyze platform usage and identify opportunities for autoscaling, cluster optimization, consolidation and workload tuning. Our clients typically save 25-40% reduction in cloud infrastructure costs.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Airflow & Databricks Cost Guardrails</strong><br />
                        Specifically on <span class="tooltip" data-key="apache-airflow">Airflow</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-key="databricks">Databricks</span>, we implement tagging, quota limits, runtime monitoring, and policy enforcement to prevent cost overruns and optimize resource utilization. When using <span class="tooltip" data-key="astronomer">Astronomer</span> we also leverage <span class="tooltip" data-key="astronomer-observe">Astronomer Observe</span> for greater insights into workflow efficiency.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Metadata-Driven Cost Attribution</strong><br />
                        With a combination of automatically surfaced meta data using AI driven tools, and manual tagging for specific business use cases, our team aligns spend-to-use-cases and teams using Unity Catalog + observability metadata, supporting chargeback models and cost transparency.
